13. "united eight niner seven leaving flight level one niner zero for flight level two three zero requesting ride reports this altitude moderate turbulence",

Follow these specific guidelines for ATC formatting:
1. Convert spelled-out numbers to digits for flight callsigns (e.g., "delta six three eight" → "Delta 638")
2. Format altitude and flight levels properly (e.g., "flight level two five zero" → "FL250" or "flight level 250")
3. Convert headings to proper format (e.g., "heading three four zero" → "heading 340")
4. Handle all numeric values according to standard ATC conventions
5. Provide clear, professional formatting while maintaining the original meaning

Analyze the communication intentions and extract any relevant numerical data like altitudes, headings, and speeds.
